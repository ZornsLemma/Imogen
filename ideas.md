# Enhancements

* There is a little bit of sprite flicker - it would be nice if the code could be optimised to get rid of this.

* It would be nice to be able to create new levels - ideally (pipedream) with a graphical editor, although even being able to do it by hand-writing a bit of custom assembler and throwing it with some graphics and level designs into a Python script would still be cool.

* ADFS/Econet-friendly build, e.g. saving in current directory on launch instead of :0.I?

* Use non-slashed zero when showing the number of transformations remaining?

# Hacks

* Could the duck be made more widely available?

* Build in a "reset transformation count" or "infinite transformations" cheat? Ideally in some way that it's obvious when it's used.

# Other versions

* The Micro User review (June 1986, p33) says Imogen was available on cassette. Did this load individual levels from tape or did they load in batches?

* https://www.retrovideogamer.co.uk/imogen-reviewed-bbc-micro-acorn-electron/ mentions a "slimmed down" version for the Electron.
