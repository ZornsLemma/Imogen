# Enhancements

* There is a little bit of sprite flicker - it would be nice if the code could be optimised to get rid of this.

* It would be nice to be able to create new levels - ideally (pipedream) with a graphical editor, although even being able to do it by hand-writing a bit of custom assembler and throwing it with some graphics and level designs into a Python script would still be cool.

# Hacks

* Could the duck be made more widely available?

* Build in a "reset transformation count" or "infinite transformations" cheat? Ideally in some way that it's obvious when it's used.
