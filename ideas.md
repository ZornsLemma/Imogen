# Enhancements

* There is a little bit of sprite flicker - it would be nice if the code could be optimised to get rid of this.

* It would be nice to be able to create new levels - ideally (pipedream) with a graphical editor, although even being able to do it by hand-writing a bit of custom assembler and throwing it with some graphics and level designs into a Python script would still be cool.

* ADFS/Econet-friendly build, e.g. saving in current directory on launch instead of :0.I?

* Use non-slashed zero when showing the number of transformations remaining?

* Maybe ask on e.g. stardot if there are any known bugs? Of course we might discover these independently or discover new ones during disassembly.

# Hacks

* Could the duck be made more widely available?

* Build in a "reset transformation count" or "infinite transformations" cheat? Ideally in some way that it's obvious when it's used.

* Add a cheat (e.g. via a password) to freeze the mouse ball in Saxophobia? A generalised version of this - not sure if useful elsewhere - would be to stop non-player movement or something like that.

* Add a cheat code to avoid screen blanking when changing room/level, allowing the user to observe the redraw process.

# Other versions

* The Micro User review (June 1986, p33) says Imogen was available on cassette. Did this load individual levels from tape or did they load in batches?

* https://www.retrovideogamer.co.uk/imogen-reviewed-bbc-micro-acorn-electron/ mentions a "slimmed down" version for the Electron.

* I don't think the game was ported to other systems, but I haven't checked. It might be interesting to try a C64 or Atari 8-bit port. (Or to any system, but at least with a 6502-based one, the core game logic could be reused.)
