These files were extracted from the Imogen SSD at http://bbcmicro.co.uk/game.php?id=512. For reference, the SSD has md5sum 0f3dcc31a1a4af22bd4e0cc848411733, but this could obviously change if any small tweaks are made.

imogen-trailing-mc-3900.dat is the chunk of machine code appended to the "$.IMOGEN" BASIC program.

g.dat is an unmodified version of the "$.G" machine code file.
