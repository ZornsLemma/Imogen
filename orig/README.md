These files were extracted from the Imogen SSD at http://bbcmicro.co.uk/game.php?id=512. For reference, the SSD has md5sum 0f3dcc31a1a4af22bd4e0cc848411733, but this could obviously change if any small tweaks are made.

imogen-trailing-mc-3900.dat is the chunk of machine code at the end of the "$.IMOGEN" BASIC program.

All other files are unmodified versions of the corresponding files on the SSD.
